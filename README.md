# FAQ:

## Q: HD/Reforged assets don't work!
Currently only Humans and Orcs are available in the HD mode, make sure to select those races in your custom game settings.

## Q: Campaign doesn't work!
That's correct. Use Custom game mode.

## Q: My internet stopped working!
To enable offline mode, the launcher needs to enable a system proxy to be able to modify traffic on the fly, sometimes this might not get enabled/disabled properly and user will be left in a broken state, to disable such proxy manually go to "Proxy Settings" and disable the `Use a proxy server` switch.
